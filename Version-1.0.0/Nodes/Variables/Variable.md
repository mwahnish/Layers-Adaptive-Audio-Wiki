# Variable Node

## About

The Variable node allows data to be used in the graph, either from named variables from the Graph Input node, or as a constant defined on the Variable node.

## Constant mode
Constant mode is active when the Is Graph Input option is unchecked. In constant mode, the value output by the variable node is defined directly on the node. In constant mode, the following options are available:

Option | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
Type | Type Selector | The type of the constant output by this node
Value | Varies | The value of the constant

## Graph Variable Mode
Graph Variable Mode is active when the Is Graph Variable checkbox is set to True. In Graph Variable Mode, this node outputs the value of the selected named variable from the Graph Input node.
