# Getting Started

This tutorial will walk you through using Layers, from installation to building a working adaptive music system. At the end of this tutorial, you will have created a music system that layers on music elements depending on an intensity value.

Note, Layers is an extremely flexible tool, so there's many ways to build an adaptive music system. The recommended way is to use the [State Machine Node](Docs/Nodes/Playback/State-machine). In this tutorial, we will opt not to use the State Machine Node in favor of building the logic manually. This approach is less efficient but provides a much better tour of Layer's systems and the tools available to you.
