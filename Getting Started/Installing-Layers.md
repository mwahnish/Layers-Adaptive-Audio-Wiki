To get started, lets first install and configure Layers!

## Getting Layers
If you haven't already, purchase and download Layers from the Unity Asset Store

## Installing Layers
Once Layers is downloaded, import it into your project. The Install Layers wizard will show. Note - if you close this dialog, you can open it again from Tools -> Layers Installer -> Install Layers.
