# Setting Up Audio

Layers works directly with Unity AudioClips. In this tutorial, we'll be building a music system that fades in musical elements depending on an intensity value. At low intensity values, the music system will just play a drum track. As the intensity increases, the system will layer on a beat, and eventually a lead. 

To continue, we'll need some music stems to work with. We'll be using the free [House Vives pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/house-vibes-153650) from [DARRY2VANCE](https://darry2vance.com/), but feel free to bring your own! Either way, add the files to your project, and you're ready to begin!
