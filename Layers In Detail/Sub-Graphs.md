![Sub Graph Example](IMG/SubGraphExample.png)

Subgraphs are Sound Graphs that are nested within other Sound Graphs. Sound Graphs are useful for reusing functions and processes across Sound Graphs and keeping individial graphs from getting too complex. Any Sound Graph can be used as a subgraph using the SubGraph node. See the [documentation for the SubGraph node](Sub-Graph) for more usage details.
