## About
Layers relies on and integrates with Unity's built in [audio mixing system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AudioMixer.html). No need to learn something new! Audio can be sent to the Unity Audio Mixer using [Audio Out](Audio-Outs) nodes, and the Audio Mixer can be interacted with using the [Find Snapshot](Find-Snapshot), [Get Mixer Parameter](Get-Mixer-Parameter), [Set Mixer Parameter](Set-Mixer-Parameter), and [Transition to Snapshots](Transition-To-Snapshots) nodes.
