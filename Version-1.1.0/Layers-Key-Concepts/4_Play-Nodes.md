# Play Nodes

## About

![Play Nodes Example](/IMG/PlayNodesExample.png)

The Play node is the main system for playing back audio in a Sound Graph. The Play node supports full multi-track audio editing and playback, MIDI and event sequencing, and looping. Audio and MIDI can be predefined at build, or can be dynamically swapped out at runtime using Sound Graph Logic. See the [Play Node](/Docs/Nodes/Playback/Play) documentation for usage information.
