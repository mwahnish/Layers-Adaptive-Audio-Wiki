# Installing Layers

To get started, lets first install and configure Layers!

## Getting Layers
If you haven't already, purchase and download Layers from the Unity Asset Store.

## Installing Layers
Once Layers is downloaded, import it into your project. The Install Layers wizard will show. Note - if you close this dialog, you can open it again from Tools -> Layers Installer -> Install Layers.

Click on the Get Started button to move on to the next step and configure Layers for your project.

Layers uses code generation to make the audio systems you create easier for programmers to work with. Pick an empty folder in your project (create it if needed!) using the wizard, then press the "Continue" button.

Finally, click the Install button to begin installing Layers. Note, if you are upgrading Layers, the installer may prompt you to backup your project prior to continuing. If you see this, it means a major change in the Layers system has been made between the version in your project and the latest version, and an install script will need to edit your files to maintain compatibility. If you cancel the install to do a backup, you can always restart the install process later!
