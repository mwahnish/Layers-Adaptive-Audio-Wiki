# Layers Adaptive Audio System
Thank you for using the Layers Adaptive Audio System for Unity! Layers is an extremely flexible visual tool for sound design and adaptive music in games. We hope you enjoy it! If you're just getting started we recommend checking out this [tutorial](/Docs/Getting-Started/1_Getting-Started) which will get you up and running. The best way to learn Layers is hands-on! Otherwise, please take a look at [Layers in Detail](/Docs/Layers-Key-Concepts/0_Layers-Key-Concepts), which contains deep-dives on several aspects of the Layers system, or the Layers [Node Reference](Docs/Nodes/Nodes).
